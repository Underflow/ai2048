Project overview
================

A reinforcement learning algorithm for the 2048 game using decisions tree and a
genetic algorithm.

The AI doesn't know the consequences of it's actions, it only see the game
state and it's score. No heuristic is used : the goal is to see if it is
possible for an AI to learn how to solve the game by itself.

Results
=======

At the moment, it is able to learn but it has not solved the game yet !

Best score : 10620 (after 10min training, did a 1024 tile)
